Based on Jon Larimer's Talk at ShmooCon 2011 (in Washington DC):
    USB Autorun attacks against Linux

He used something similar to this to show ASLR weaknesses about halfway
through the talk.  I figured it'd be simple enough to whip one together

I'll be first writing a python tester, then transferring it to C.
Next I'll be doing it in go, but this time massively parallelized (to see how concurrent calls affect it).
The idea is if we guarantee concurrent calls to the library, will it still move in memory (using a dedicated programmed USB device)

I'll probably also put handy plotting scripts in here for gnuplot cause i like gnuplot

Basic overview:
# launch process
# get pid
# /proc/pid/mmap
# tells where addr of each libraries
# look for libc
# log to output

From there we plot the results to see which addresses are more common than
others, and those will be targets for following hacks.
