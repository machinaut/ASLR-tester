Based on Jon Larimer's Talk at ShmooCon 2011 (in Washington DC):
    USB Autorun attacks against Linux

He used something similar to this to show ASLR weaknesses about halfway
through the talk.  I figured it'd be simple enough to whip one together

Basic overview:
# launch process w/ go
# get pid
# /proc/pid/mmap
# tells where addr of each libraries
# look for libc
# log to output

From there we plot the results to see which addresses are more common than
others, and those will be targets for following hacks.
